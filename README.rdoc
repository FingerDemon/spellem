== Welcome to Spell em

This is a Ruby on Rails application with the intention of helping students practice their spelling words. It will also help me learn the intricacies of developing a Rails application from scratch. I plan to use the google ‘text to speech’ tts gem to allow the system to read the words to the user, to give them to chance to spell it without seeing it.
